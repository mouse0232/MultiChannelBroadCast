## Configuration

Create a `.env` file and configure the following environment variables:

### Core Configuration

```env
## Multi-channel configuration - use commas to separate multiple channels (required)
CHANNELS=channel1,channel2,channel3

## Or use a single channel (backward compatibility)
CHANNEL=your_channel_name

## Site name
SITE_NAME=My Multi-Channel Blog

## Language and timezone
LOCALE=zh-cn
TIMEZONE=Asia/Shanghai
```

### Social Media Configuration

```env
## Social media usernames
TELEGRAM=your_telegram
TWITTER=your_twitter
GITHUB=your_github

## Social media that requires full URLs
MASTODON=https://mastodon.social/@username
BLUESKY=https://bsky.app/profile/username
DISCORD=https://discord.gg/invite
PODCAST=https://your-podcast.com
```

### Advanced Configuration

```env
## Telegram host (generally no need to change)
TELEGRAM_HOST=t.me

## Static resource proxy (optional)
STATIC_PROXY=/static/

## Enable Telegram comments
## Set to true to display the Telegram comment section on the post detail page
## Note: The channel must have the discussion group feature enabled
COMMENTS=true

## Code injection (supports HTML)
HEADER_INJECT=<!-- Google Analytics -->
FOOTER_INJECT=<!-- Footer tracking code -->

## Sentry error tracking (optional)
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
SENTRY_PROJECT=your_project
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
```


## Custom Styling

Style files are in the `src/assets/` directory:

- `normalize.css` - CSS reset
- `style.css` - Main styles
- `item.css` - Article item styles
- `global.css` - Global styles

You can directly modify these files to customize the website's appearance.

**Suggestions**:
- Don't set too many channels (recommend ≤5)
- Appropriately increase cache time
- Use a proxy (if needed)

### How are multi-channel contents sorted?

All channel contents are sorted in **reverse chronological order** by publication time, with the newest content appearing first. Deduplication is also performed to avoid duplicate displays.

### How to distinguish content from different channels?

A "From channel: @channel_name" will be displayed below each piece of content, which can be clicked to jump to that channel.

### How to enable the comment function?

1. Add `COMMENTS=true` to the `.env` file
2. Ensure your Telegram channel has the discussion group feature enabled
3. Click the post timestamp to enter the detail page, and the comment section will appear below

**Notes**:
- The comment function uses the official Telegram widget, and data is stored on Telegram
- Only messages from channels with discussion groups enabled can display comments
- The comment section loads asynchronously and may take a few seconds
- A maximum of 50 comments are displayed per post
